# Introduction to Deep Learning

This course provides an introduction to the concepts, mathematical models, construction and use of Deep Neural Networks: models that are composed of several layers of nonlinear processing. The class will focus on the main features in Deep Neural Networks structures. Specific topics include Multi-Layer Perceptron, Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, and Generative Adversarial Networks. The concepts introduced will be illustrated by examples of applications chosen among various areas.

# Setting Up a Python Development Environment

## Devops-Setup
Deep learning tools like python, pytorch, tensorflow, keras, etc can be set up by following the instructions in the [Devops Setup Tool](https://git.web.boeing.com/DevHub/devops-setup#windows). In addition, there are numerous channels on the [DevHub MatterMost](https://mattermost.web.boeing.com/devhub) with vibrant support communities for tools like Python and VsCode.
